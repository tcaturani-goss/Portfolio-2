    <h1>Plantiva Rebranding</h1>

    />
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      Plantiva is an immune supplement company that uses all-natural and
      plant-based ingredients to make each one of their products. They currently
      have branding established but would prefer their branding have a more
      updated and refined look.
    </p>
    <p>
      They recently started selling many of their products on Amazon to boost
      sales and the number of consumers they reach. Since they are just now
      moving over to Amazon and have a lot of new products coming down the
      pipeline, they are looking to come out with a bang with a rebrand of the
      logo, brand colors, and labels.
    </p>
    <h3>Main Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rebrand Plantiva's colors, logo, and labels</li>
      <li>
        Create coherent branding that aligns with Plantiva's current and future
        customer base
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rebranding Process</h2>

      alt="myrebrandingprocessimg"
      class="rebrandimg"
    />
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <h3>Research Plan</h3>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the rebranding process, it is essential to understand
      who the client is, the consumer, and the target audience they are trying
      to market to, and their competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why having a solid research plan is crucial because it ensures
      that the rebranding process goes by smoothly. I have listed goals within
      my research plan that will help clarify key points in the rebranding
      process.
    </p>
    <h3>Research Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the supplement market</li>
      <li>Identify the consumer and target audience</li>
      <li>
        Identify Plantiva's main competitors and how they cater to customers
        while pinpointing their strengths/weaknesses.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Market Research</h3>
    <p>
      Market research gives us a better idea of what market our target audience
      falls in and how to cater our designs to that market. It also helps with
      better understanding consumer personas and building them to reflect the
      ideal consumer.

    <h3>Persona's</h3>
    <p>
      After reviewing the market research, it was time to refine the initial
      personas of Plantiva's target audience. Below are personas that will help
      me better understand how to contour my designs to reach the intended
      target audience.
    </p>
    <div class="personaimgs">
      <img src="dadpersona.png" alt="activedadpersona" class="dadpersona" />
      <img
        src="millennialpersona.png"
        alt="healthymillenialpersona"
        class="millennialpersona"
      />
      <img
        src="seniorpersona.png"
        alt="livelyseniorpersona"
        class="seniorpersona"
      />
    </div>
    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Once I have refined and reviewed the personas of the target audience we
      are trying to reach, it is time to do competitive research to understand
      better how Plantiva's competition is connecting with customers and
      reaching the target audience. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of the
      competition is a great way to gain an extra step ahead by catering to
      customers' needs/wants and going above and beyond the competitors.
    </p>

      <img
        src="beekeepersanalysis.png"
        alt="competitiveanalysisbeekeepers"
        class="beekeepers"
      />
      <img

        alt="competitiveanalysisnewchapter"
        class="newchapter"
      />
    </div>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <h3>Mood Board</h3>
    <p>
      When it came to designing the mood board, we wanted to set a branding
      color palette of calm colors that would pair well with social media design
      backgrounds as well labeling in the future. One of our main goals with the
      new color palette was to have it correlate with the personas of our target
      audience. Hence the reason the bottom right image is a picture of "The
      Active Dad" enjoying a beach trip with his wife and children he adores.
      The top middle image is "The Lively Senior," who is happy to be living
      healthy for her family and glad to be enjoying time with them. Then we
      have a few images to resemble "The Healthy Millennial," one of her making
      an organic smoothy to pose with and share the recipe on social media or
      one of her working on her naturally grown plants which she prefers in any
      of her supplements. The new palette blends well with the vibrant, natural,
      and trustworthy image that Plantiva is looking to emanate.
    </p>

      class="moodboard"
    />
    <h3>Logos</h3>
    <p>
      The CEO wanted to see what a logo design with roots incorporated into it
      would look like, so I took this opportunity to make a logo that could be
      used as a secondary logo and explained the importance of having
      primary/secondary designs.
    </p>
    <img
      src="Logo Mockup with leaves 2.png"
      alt="leaveswindowmockup"
      class="leavesmockupimg"
    />
    <p>
      The project manager wanted to see what a line drawing of one of our
      ingredients would look like incorporated into a logo, so we decided to
      make mockup designs with astragalus leaves integrated into the designs.
